## Updated 5-13-2018

This app was my first solo project with react. It required multiple nested fetch calls. I implemented react-router for the first time on this project as well. My test coverage is not exactly where I'd like it to be. I didn't find testing the functions that call fetch to be overly difficult, but I did make sure to write them all individually instead of just copying and pasting them once I had figured it out for one function. This set me a little behind and caused me to run out of time for more tests, but I think it was a good call because now I'm VERY comfortable with mocking functions, fetch calls, and data for tests. The one thing missing from the functionality of the app itself is the functionality of adding a class to the button or card to illustrate that a card has been selected as a "favorite"

## Installation
